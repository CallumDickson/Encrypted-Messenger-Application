# Encrypted-Messenger-Application

## Overview:
Quick 2 week C# project for Uni. A messaging application was created using Client/Server contracts. These contracts provided a mechanism to pass data between clients using separate Messengers. Encryption was performed before reaching the Server to insure the integrity of the message would never be accessible through hacking the Server. Decryption was performed done on the recipient side, again reassuring the safety of its content. 

## Setup:
There are two optinons to set up.

### To test:

- Open `ChattingServer.exe` from `ChattingServer/bin/Debug`
