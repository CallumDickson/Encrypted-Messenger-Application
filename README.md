# Encrypted-Messenger-Application

The messaging system was made possible through the creation Client to Server and Server to Client contracts. These contracts provided a mechanism to pass data between clients using separate Messengers. Encryption was done before reaching the Server to insure the integrity of the message would never be accessible through hacking the Server. The decryption was done on the recipient side, again reassuring the safety of its content. 

A method that saved and stored the encrypted messages sent through the communication software had been created. This application therefore provide Financial Advisors and WOW members with encrypted text file outputs. Each of these text files continues the users who sent the message, if they were private and the time and date they were sent.
